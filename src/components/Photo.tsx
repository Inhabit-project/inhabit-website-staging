              By buying an NFT you become a lifelong steward of a specific Hub, allowing you to monitor and participate in important decisions that affect these ecosystems, and gain exclusive access to bio-cultural experiences, events, workshops, visit the hubs and explore the whole Corridor.

              The funds raised from these NFTs are used to acquire degraded lands and transform them into Bio-Cultural Hubs.
